# what I leared:
# 1. in C++ and JAVA, the list's length is fixed. Not like Python, it don't have thise problem. 
# so, for any of those small string replaced by a bigger string, you needed to consider if the list
# will not be able to handle all the charators. But, Python don't have this requirment.
# 

string = '   abcd   edg '
