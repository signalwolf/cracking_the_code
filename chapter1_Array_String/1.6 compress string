# it is just that remeber the string contantnce needed a lots of time, it's better to use append:

string = 'aaabbbcccdddaaa'

def main (str1):
    curr, counter = str1[0], 0
    result = ''
    for i in str1:
        if i != curr:
            result = result + curr + str(counter)
            curr = i
            counter = 0
        if i == curr:
            counter += 1
    result = result + curr + str(counter)
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print main (string)
