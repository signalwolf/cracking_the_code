# what I learned:
# 1. as mentioned before, you must ask if white space and case sencitive questions. 
# 2. it is a good way to think about problem, first, what's the defination of palidorm?
# and then what's the feature it have ? then how to check this feature?
# 3. when white space and other special char is not count, think twice. You needed to
# limited the string by check the ord(i) is within ord('a') and ord ('z'). You must know
# the ord ('a') != ord ('A')
# 4. must redo this with bit change, the method looks so great. 


string = 'aaacbaccc'
# this function could have problem, if the white char and other special char is not count
# this function is wrong.
